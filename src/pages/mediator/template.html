  <h2>Mediator Pattern</h2>
  <p>
    The Mediator pattern introduces a single entity, known as the mediator, to
    encapsulate and manage how a set of objects interact with each other. This
    design pattern promotes the principle of loose coupling by ensuring that
    instead of objects communicating directly, they do so through the mediator.
    This approach simplifies the dependencies between interacting classes,
    making it easier to modify, extend, and maintain them. The Mediator pattern
    is especially useful in scenarios where an application consists of numerous
    components that need to work in a coordinated fashion.
