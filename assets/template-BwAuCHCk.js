  <h2>Singleton Pattern</h2>
  <p>
    The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has just one instance and
    provides a global point of access to it. This is useful for managing
    resources like connection pools or configurations.

  <h3>Example:</h3>
  <pre id="example"></pre>
</div>
`;export{n as default};
