  <h2>Mixin Pattern</h2>
  <p>
    The Mixin pattern allows objects to borrow (or inherit) functionality from
    them without entering into a formal relationship of inheritance. It's a way
    to add features to objects without complicating their inheritance.

  <h3>Example:</h3>
  <pre id="example"></pre>

  <div class="pagination"><a href="/catalog/structure/facade">Facade</a><a href="/catalog/structure/decorator">Decorator</a></div>
</div>
